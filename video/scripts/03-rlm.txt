I wrote previously about moving from RAG to Recursive Language Models for document processing. That was the theory. Here's the production update.

At a top consultancy firm in Ireland, we process regulatory documents. Compliance filings. Policy documents. Regulatory guidance notes. The kind of documents where getting an answer wrong isn't an inconvenience — it's a compliance failure.

RAG gave us seventy-two percent accuracy on complex regulatory queries. The kind that require cross-referencing Section four point two with Appendix B and reconciling them with an amendment from six months ago.

RLM gave us ninety-one percent.

That's not a marginal improvement. That's the difference between a useful prototype and a production system.

Why does RLM work so well for regulation? Three reasons.

First, regulatory documents are full of cross-references. "As defined in Section three point one A" appears constantly. RAG retrieves one chunk without the definition. RLM navigates to the definition.

Second, amendments override original text. A regulation from twenty twenty-four might be partially superseded by a twenty twenty-five amendment. RAG doesn't know which version applies. RLM can be instructed to check.

Third, negation matters. "This requirement does NOT apply to entities classified under Category B." If your system misses the negation because it retrieved the wrong chunk, you've given wrong compliance advice.

The architecture is straightforward: generate a semantic table of contents first, then let the model navigate the document structure using tools. The expensive model reasons. The cheap model extracts. Costs stay manageable.
