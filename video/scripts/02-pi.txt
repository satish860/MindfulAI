I used Claude Code for months. It was the first CLI coding agent I tried, and for a while, it was great. Simple. Predictable.

Then it stopped being simple.

Every release changed the system prompt. Every update broke workflows I'd built. The tool definitions shifted. Claude Code turned into a spaceship with eighty percent of functionality I never used. I don't need a spaceship. I need a bicycle that works.

Pi is that bicycle.

Built by Mario Zechner, Pi is aggressively minimal. Four tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash. A system prompt under a thousand tokens. No MCP. No sub-agents. No plan mode. Just a coding agent that does what you tell it and gets out of the way.

The killer feature? Multi-model switching. We live in a multi-model world. Some tasks are better on Claude. Some on GPT. Some on DeepSeek or Gemini. With Claude Code, you're locked to Anthropic. With Pi, I switch between fifteen-plus providers mid-session. Same conversation. No restart.

When I'm reasoning through a complex regulatory question, I use Claude Sonnet. When I need fast iteration on boilerplate, I switch to a cheaper model. When I want a different reasoning style, Gemini is one keystroke away.

Pi also has a skills system that fits my Kanban workflow perfectly. I codify repeatable tasks as markdown files. The agent loads them on demand. Progressive disclosure, not context bloat.

The best tool is the one that adapts to your workflow. Not the one that forces you to adapt to it.
