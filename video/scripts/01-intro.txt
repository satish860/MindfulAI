I Rebuilt My AI Engineering Stack. Here's What Survived.

I amass tools. Not intentionally. I just kept hitting walls — with my coding agent, my document pipeline, my tool integrations — and each fix led to the next change. A month later, almost nothing in my AI engineering stack is the same.

This is what survived, what got replaced, and why. Most of it ties back to the regulation tech work we do at a top consultancy firm in Ireland, where accuracy on document processing isn't optional.
