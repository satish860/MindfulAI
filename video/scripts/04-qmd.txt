Here's something that surprised me. QMD — built by Tobi Lütke, Shopify's CEO — quietly solved a problem I'd been hacking around for months.

QMD is an on-device search engine for markdown files. It combines BM25 full-text search, vector semantic search, and LLM re-ranking. All local. All via a CLI.

For our regulatory work, this was huge. We have hundreds of markdown files — processed regulatory documents, meeting notes, compliance checklists, internal policies. Before QMD, finding the right document meant grep and memory. Now the agent can search semantically across everything, locally, in milliseconds.

QMD fits perfectly into the CLI-first philosophy. It's a tool the agent invokes via Bash. No MCP server. No context bloat. I'm still exploring its full capabilities. More on this in a future post.
