This was the most controversial change. MCP — Model Context Protocol — is Anthropic's standard for connecting AI agents to tools. It's everywhere. Every AI startup has an MCP server. Every tutorial recommends it.

I stopped using it.

Here's why. Context window bloat. Playwright MCP loads twenty-one tools and thirteen thousand seven hundred tokens into your context. Chrome DevTools MCP: twenty-six tools, eighteen thousand tokens. That's seven to nine percent of your context window consumed before you do anything. Most sessions use one or two of those tools.

MCP results aren't composable either. They have to go through the agent's context. You can't pipe output into another tool. You can't chain operations without the model mediating every step.

And there are real security concerns. Tool poisoning, tool shadowing, confused deputy problems. The specification is still evolving. Error handling isn't standardized.

The alternative is simpler than you'd think. Models know how to use Bash. They know how to read READMEs. They know how to chain commands. A browser automation README costs two hundred and twenty-five tokens. The equivalent MCP server costs over thirteen thousand. Same capabilities. Ninety-eight percent fewer tokens.

When you absolutely need an MCP server, Peter Steinberger's mcporter bridges the gap. It wraps MCP servers as CLI tools. You get the ecosystem without the overhead.

Pi's philosophy is explicit: no MCP in the core. If you need MCP, use mcporter. If you don't, use CLI tools. The agent doesn't care — it's all Bash.
